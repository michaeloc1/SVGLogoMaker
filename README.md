# SVG Logo Maker

## Description
This application takes user input and creates a custom logo for them. It currently makes 3 shapes. The user can pick a shape, add text and choose colors for their logo.  I was motivated by the need to make a simple logo quickly. I learned how to use inquirer to make user input prompts, jest for testing, and creating classes with properties and methods.

## Installation
Download the code from my github repository. You will need to install inquirer 8.2.4 and jest 29.4.3.  Inquirer is used for the user input prompts and jest is used to test the application. Once installed navigate to the command line and type node index.js.
## Usage
Once you type node index.js in the command line you are given a series of questions. What shape and color you want the logo to be, as well as what text and text color you want in your logo. Once you have completed answering all the prompts your logo is saved in the examples folder with the name logo.svg.
